<h5>Description</h5>

<p>You're almost there. You already have working buttons that can input numbers. We can't call our app a calculator yet, as it doesn't really calculate. Let's change that!</p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<p>After typing in the number and pressing an operation button (<code class="java">+</code>, <code class="java">-</code>, or else) your app should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Get the first value from <code class="java">EditText</code>, clear the <code class="java">editText</code> field, and wait for the next value;</li>
	<li>After pressing the <code class="java">equalButton</code>, your app should carry out the operation with two values that have been received earlier and display the result in <code class="java">editText</code>. Keep in mind that users should be able to use it for further calculations.</li>
	<li>If there are no numbers in your <code class="java">editText</code>, pressing the <code class="java">subtract</code> button should add a minus sign before the number.</li>
</ol>
